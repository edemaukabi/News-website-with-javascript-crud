In this implementation, I built a news application performing the crud operations of Create, Post, Put and Delete using HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript without any library or framework.
To run this program, simply clone the application, run liveserver or navigate to the index.html file in ./src/pages/index.html. From here you can navigate to other pages.
